### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Expected behavior

- The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".
